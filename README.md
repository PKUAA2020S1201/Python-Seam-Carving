# Python-Seam-Carving

Python implementation of Seam Carving.

## Introduction

This is a python implementation of seam carving algorithm, with some improvement strategies.

For detailed information of these methods, please refer to `开题报告.md` or Google. 
Actaully, none of them is difficult and I believe you can totally understand them by reading the source code.

## How to Use

We placed the core code in a module named `sc2`, 
which means that you can just import it and build your own procedures conveniently.

Moreover, we released many Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) which we used in experiments.
These notebooks can help you understand the API.

Maybe a detailed API doc will come out soon.

## Why This Exists

Actually, this repository is our team project for *算法设计与分析*.
